# Notes for Claude Code

## Project Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: This project has comprehensive AI-digestible documentation in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.

### When to Use PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

**Always scan `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` when:**
- Starting work on this project for the first time in a conversation
- You need to understand the overall architecture
- Looking for specific algorithms or implementation approaches
- Finding where specific functionality is located
- Understanding performance optimizations and configuration options

### Keeping Documentation Updated

**Edit `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` when you make significant changes:**
- Adding new algorithms or optimization techniques
- Introducing new major classes or packages
- Changing the architecture or data flow
- Modifying default configuration values
- Adding new physics features or constraints
- Making performance improvements worth documenting

### What's in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

- Core algorithms (TOI collision, spatial partitioning, impulse solver, etc.)
- Complete package structure with file paths
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Physics features and current limitations
- Performance optimizations with benchmarks
- Configuration parameters and defaults
- Test suite overview
- Quick start guide for common tasks

**Goal**: Keep PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md as a concise, AI-digestible reference that provides maximum understanding with minimal context consumption.
